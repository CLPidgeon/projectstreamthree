# The Ice Hockey Site

## Overview

### What is this site for?
The aim of the site is to eventually be the first website UK ice hockey fans visit when online. 

### What does it do?
The main point of the website is the fantasy ice hockey league, here users compete by creating their own rosters and earning 
(and losing) points through their players actions. The idea is to give users one free entry and then further entries if 
 they subscribe, with a cash prize for the league winner at the end of the season. There is a blog from the site creators
 which would update users on how the fixing of bugs, implementing of features and fantasy ice hockey is coming along. 
 There is also a forum for users to interact with each other, this is split into different subjects. Finally, there is an 
 issue tracker for users to report bugs they discover whilst using the site and to request features they would like adding.
  The idea here is to have everything free to users apart from the upvoting of features, for which they will have to 
  subscribe.
